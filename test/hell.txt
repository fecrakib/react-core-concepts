Hello developer
If the <img> tag is not working, it might be due to various reasons. Here are some potential solutions:

Check the Image URL: Ensure that the URL provided in the src attribute of the <img> tag is correct and accessible. You can try opening the URL directly in your browser to verify.

Image Size and Format: Make sure the image size and format are supported. Common formats include JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Also, ensure that the image dimensions are appropriate for display.

Browser Security: Some browsers have strict security policies regarding loading of resources from external URLs. Make sure your browser settings allow loading images from the provided URL.

HTTPS: If your site is served over HTTPS, make sure the image URL is also served over HTTPS. Browsers may block loading insecure content (HTTP) on secure pages.

File Path: If you're working with local files, double-check the file path specified in the src attribute. The path should be relative to the HTML file or an absolute path.

Network Issues: Check your network connection to ensure there are no issues preventing the browser from loading external resources.

Browser Extensions: Sometimes, browser extensions or ad blockers can interfere with image loading. Try disabling any relevant extensions to see if it resolves the issue.

If you've verified that the image URL is correct and accessible, and you're still experiencing issues, you might want to provide more details about the problem or try using a different image hosting service to see if that resolves the issue.
